This webhook integration will allow you to open a development environment on CodeSandbox
directly from a Linear issue.

You can fork this template to set this up for yourself

## How to set this up

1. Fork this repository so you get your own server and make it private in GitHub

![fork](./images/fork.png)

2. (Optional) import your repository in CodeSandbox at
   [codesandbox.io/p/dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/p/dashboard)
3. Change the configuration ([/src/config.ts](./src/config.ts)) to include your
   repositories
   1. Note, the `main` branch is protected, so you need to create a new branch
      (Branch in top right), make your changes there and then click "Open PR" to
      merge the changes back.
4. Generate an API token in Linear
   1. In Linear, go to Workspace Settings
   2. Go to API
   3. Create a personal API key
5. Add the API token to the environment variables
   1. Open the command palette (CMD/Ctrl + Shift + P) and search for "Add
      environment variables".
   2. Add the env var under the name `LINEAR_KEY`
6. Add the Webhook to Linear
   1. Go to the main branch of this repo
   2. Copy the URL
      [http://localhost:3000/linear-webhook](http://localhost:3000/linear-webhook)
      <- this URL corresponds to this branch if you open this README in
      CodeSandbox. Otherwise you can check the preview URL in the preview devtool
      on the right.
   3. In Linear, go to Workspace Settings, and add it to the Webhooks under API
7. Now you will have CodeSandbox links in Linear for new issues!
